fscftl Fully name Full Stack Control FTL
it's a Full Host-based FTL solution

the HW expose PPA interface to Host, and we manage the physical page address(PPA) directly in Host side
so different with tradition device-base solution, the PPA in visible on Host perspective,  
we can utility Host high-performance CPU to accelerate I/O response, and get good iops/BW/Latency

Module:
Host write datapath
Host read datapath
write cache manage
Garbage Collection
power on/off
Read Error-handle(Read retry->1DX->BSPP1)
Program Fail-Handle
BadBlock Manage
Wear-Leveling
